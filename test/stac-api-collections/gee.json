This collection\nincludes the S1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes, processed\nusing the Sentinel-1 Toolbox to generate a calibrated, ortho-corrected\nproduct. The collection is updated daily. New assets are ingested\nwithin two days after they become available.\n\nThis collection\ncontains all of the GRD scenes.  Each scene has one of 3 resolutions\n(10, 25 or 40 meters), 4 band combinations (corresponding to\nscene polarization) and 3 instrument modes.  Use of the collection\nin a mosaic context will likely require filtering down to a homogeneous\nset of bands and parameters.  See\n[this article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1)\nfor details of collection use and preprocessing. Each scene contains\neither 1 or 2 out of 4 possible polarization bands, depending\non the instrument's polarization settings.  The possible combinations\nare single band VV or HH, and dual band VV+VH and HH+HV:\n\n  1. VV: single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive\n  2. HH: single co-polarization, horizontal transmit/horizontal receive\n  3. VV + VH: dual-band cross-polarization, vertical transmit/horizontal\n  receive\n  4. HH + HV: dual-band cross-polarization, horizontal transmit/vertical\n  receive\n\nEach scene also includes an additional 'angle' band that contains\nthe approximate incidence angle from ellipsoid in degrees at every point.\nThis band is generated by interpolating the 'incidenceAngle' property\nof the 'geolocationGridPoint' gridded field provided with each asset.\n\nEach scene was pre-processed with\n[Sentinel-1 Toolbox](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes/sentinel-1)\nusing the following steps:\n\n  1. Thermal noise removal\n  2. Radiometric calibration\n  3.

The difference between\nobserved and modelled reflectance results in the AAI.  When the AAI is\npositive, it indicates the presence of UV-absorbing aerosols like dust and\nsmoke. It is useful for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from\ndust outbreaks, volcanic ash, and biomass burning.\n\nThe wavelengths used have very low ozone absorption, so unlike aerosol optical\nthickness measurements, AAI can be calculated in the presence of clouds.\nDaily global coverage is therefore possible.\n\nFor this L3 AER_AI product, the absorbing_aerosol_index is calculated with a\npair of measurements at the 354 nm and 388 nm wavelengths.\n\n### NRTI L3 Product\n\nTo make our NRTI L3 products, we use\n[harpconvert](https://stcorp.github.io/harp/doc/html/harpconvert.html) to grid the data.\n\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'absorbing_aerosol_index_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time});\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\nkeep(absorbing_aerosol_index,sensor_altitude,sensor_azimuth_angle,\n     sensor_zenith_angle,solar_azimuth_angle,solar_zenith_angle)'\nS5P_NRTI_L2__AER_AI_20181113T080042_20181113T080542_05618_01_010200_20181113T083707.nc\noutput.h5\n```\n\n### Sentinel-5 Precursor\n\nSentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017\nby the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution.  The onboard sensor\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\n\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\n\nBecause of noise on the data, negative vertical column values are often\nobserved in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions.

For applications requiring\n   an overall uncertainty estimate, we propose to multiply the provided\n   error by a factor 2, which reflects the scatter of single sounding errors\n   in the TCCON validation.\n\n - Data prior to November 2021 only provides XCH<sub>4</sub> over land,\n   after which glint ocean observations were added.\n\n - No data are present between 2022-07-26 and 2022-08-31 due to a\n   [provider outage](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/news/News01082).\n\n### OFFL L3 Product\n\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find which areas within the product's\nbounding box contain data by using a command like this:\n\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20190223T202409_20190223T220540_07072_01_010202_20190301T221106.nc\ngrid_info.h5\n```\n\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (area-averaging values for\npixels that may have different values for different times).

The SLGA can be used in studies of vadose zone\nprocesses, including solute transport, groundwater and nutrient fluxes\nbeyond the root zone, as well as a wide spectrum of ecological,\nhydrological, and broader environmental applications.\n\nEach product contains six digital soil attribute maps and their upper and\nlower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths:\n0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, and 100-200cm. These depths and\nsoil attributes are consistent with the specifications of\n[GlobalSoilMap](https://www.isric.org/projects/globalsoilmapnet).\n\nThis collection has 12 images. Ten of them contain data for GSM primary\nsoil attributes; the other two contain regolith depth and soil depth GSM\nattributes.\n\n| Attribute                              | Description                                                                                                                   | Code | # of Bands |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------------|\n| Bulk Density (whole earth)             | Bulk density of the whole soil (including coarse fragments) in mass per unit volume by a method equivalent to the core method | BDW  | 18         |\n| Organic Carbon                         | Mass fraction of carbon by weight in the < 2mm soil material as determined by dry combustion at 900 Celsius                   | SOC  | 18         |\n| Clay                                   | < 2μm mass fraction of the <2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                             | CLY  | 18         |\n| Silt                                   | 2-20μm mass fraction of the < 2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                           | SLT  | 18         |\n| Sand                                   | 20μm - 2mm mass fraction of the < 2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                       | SND  | 18         |\n| pH (CaCl2)                             | pH of 1:5 soil/0.01M calcium chloride extract                                                                                 | pHc  | 18         |\n| Available Water Capacity               | Available water capacity computed for each of the specified depth increments                                                  | AWC  | 18         |\n| Total Nitrogen                         | Mass fraction of total nitrogen in the soil by weight                                                                         | NTO  | 18         |\n| Total Phosphorus                       | Mass fraction of total phosphorus in the soil by weight                                                                       | PTO  | 18         |\n| Effective Cation Exchange Capacity     | Cations extracted using barium chloride (BaCl2) plus exchangeable H + Al                                                      | ECE  | 18         |\n| Depth of Regolith                      | Depth to hard rock.

In a first step\npixels with a high probability of being burned (called \"seeds\") are detected\nbased on the active fires. In a second one, a contextual growing is applied to\ncompletely detect the fire patch. This growing phase is controlled by an\nadaptive thresholding, where thresholds are computed based on the specific\ncharacteristics of the area surrounding each seed. The variable used to guide\nthe whole detection process is the NIR drop between pre- and post-fire images.\n\nThe dataset includes for each pixel the estimated day of the first detection of\nthe fire, the confidence level of that detection, and the land cover that has\nbeen burned (extracted from the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset v2.0.7).

It uses climatically aided interpolation,\ncombining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the\n[WorldClim dataset](https://www.worldclim.org/), with coarser spatial\nresolution, but time-varying data from\n[CRU Ts4.0](https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/cru/data/cru_ts/) and the\n[Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55)](https://jra.kishou.go.jp/JRA-55/index_en.html).\nConceptually, the procedure applies interpolated time-varying anomalies\nfrom CRU Ts4.0/JRA55 to the high-spatial resolution climatology of\nWorldClim to create a high-spatial resolution dataset that covers a broader\ntemporal record.\n\nTemporal information is inherited from CRU Ts4.0 for most global land\nsurfaces for temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure. However,\nJRA55 data is used for regions where CRU data had zero climate stations\ncontributing (including all of Antarctica, and parts of Africa,\nSouth America, and scattered islands). For primary climate variables of\ntemperature, vapor pressure, and precipitation, the University of Idaho\nprovides additional data on the number of stations (between 0 and 8) that\ncontributed to the CRU Ts4.0 data used by TerraClimate. JRA55 was used\nexclusively for solar radiation and wind speeds.\n\nTerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets\nusing a water balance model that incorporates reference evapotranspiration,\nprecipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water\ncapacity. A modified Thornthwaite-Mather climatic water-balance model and\nextractable soil water storage capacity data was used at a 0.5° grid from\nWang-Erlandsson et al. (2016).\n\nData Limitations:\n\n 1. Long-term trends in data are inherited from parent datasets.\n    TerraClimate should not be used directly for independent assessments of\n    trends.\n\n 2. TerraClimate will not capture temporal variability at finer scales than\n    parent datasets and thus is not able to capture variability in\n    orographic precipitation ratios and inversions.\n\n 3. The water balance model is very simple and does not account for\n    heterogeneity in vegetation types or their physiological response to\n    changing environmental conditions.\n\n 4.

Therefore, night time acquisitions cannot be processed to\n  surface temperature.\n\n* A known error exists in the surface temperature retrievals relative\n  to clouds and possibly cloud shadows.

The merged band\n  contains unsaturated pixels from Band 6H. If Band 6H pixels have a BT\n  outside of the 6H dynamic range (240 to 322 Kelvin) then 6L band pixels\n  are used.

All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection. See more\ninformation [in the USGS\ndocs](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collections).\n\nThe T1_RT collection contains both Tier 1 and Real-Time (RT) assets.\nNewly-acquired Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data are processed\nupon downlink but use predicted ephemeris, initial bumper mode parameters,\nor initial TIRS line of sight model parameters. The data is placed in the\nReal-Time tier and made available for immediate download. Once the data\nhave been reprocessed with definitive ephemeris, updated bumper mode\nparameters and refined TIRS parameters, the products are transitioned to\neither Tier 1 or Tier 2 and removed from the Real-Time tier. The transition\ndelay from Real-Time to Tier 1 or Tier 2 is between 14 and 26 days.\n\nNote that [Landsat 7's orbit has been drifting to an earlier acquisition time since\n2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017221000134?via%3Dihub).\n","license":"PDDL-1.0","providers":[{"name":"USGS","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-7-data-users-handbook"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LE07_C02_T1_RT"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","2023-01-29T02:28:39"]]}},"links":[{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_RT","rel":"self","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections","rel":"parent","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/","rel":"root","type":"application/json"},{"code":"JavaScript","href":"https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=Examples:Datasets/LANDSAT_LE07_C02_T1_RT","rel":"related","title":"Run the example for LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_RT in the Earth Engine Code Editor","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/images/LANDSAT/LANDSAT_LE07_C02_T1_RT_sample.png","rel":"preview","type":"image/png"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LE07_C02_T1_RT#terms-of-use","rel":"license","type":"text/html"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[],"type":"Collection","id":"LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_RT_TOA","title":"USGS Landsat 7 Collection 2 Tier 1 and Real-Time data TOA Reflectance","description":"Landsat 7 Collection 2 Tier 1 and Real-Time data\n  calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.\n  Calibration coefficients are extracted from the image metadata.\n  See [Chander et al.

They also contain intermediate bands used in\ncalculation of the ST products, as well as QA bands.\n\nLandsat 7 SR products are created with the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance\nAdaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) algorithm (version 3.4.0).\nAll Collection 2 ST products are created with a single-channel algorithm\njointly created by the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\n\nStrips of collected data are packaged into overlapping \\\"scenes\\\" covering approximately\n170km x 183km using a [standardized reference grid](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/worldwide-reference-system).\n\nSome assets have only SR data, in which case ST bands are present but empty.\nFor assets with both ST and SR bands, 'PROCESSING_LEVEL' is set to 'L2SP'.\nFor assets with only SR bands, 'PROCESSING_LEVEL' is set to 'L2SR'.\n\n[Additional documentation and usage examples.](/earth-engine/guides/landsat)\n\nData provider notes:\n\n* Data products must contain both optical and thermal data to be\n  successfully processed to surface temperature, as ASTER NDVI is\n  required to temporally adjust the ASTER GED product to the target Landsat\n  scene. Therefore, night time acquisitions cannot be processed to\n  surface temperature.\n\n* A known error exists in the surface temperature retrievals relative\n  to clouds and possibly cloud shadows.

The merged band\n  contains unsaturated pixels from Band 6H. If Band 6H pixels have a BT\n  outside of the 6H dynamic range (240 to 322 Kelvin) then 6L band pixels\n  are used.

After a minimum\namount of hand-editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with\nexisting quality-controlled river network datasets in terms of flow accumulation\narea and river basin shape (see Figure 9a in the paper). The location of river\nstreamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global\nriver channel data (see Figure 10a in the paper). Relative error\nin the drainage area was smaller than 0.05 for 90% of GRDC gauges, confirming\nthe accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation\narea were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally\nconnected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries.\n\nMERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography datasets in terms of spatial\ncoverage (between 90N and 60S) and representation of small streams, mainly due\nto increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial datasets.\n\n[You can use this web app to visualize MERIT Hydro data.](https://meritdataset.users.earthengine.app/view/merit-hydro-visualization-and-interactive-map)\n[The app's source code is available.](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/datasets/scripts/Hydro_Visualization.js)\n\nKnown Problems:\n\n* River width (Update from GWD-LR v1): Width algorithm was updated to consider\n  sub-pixel water fraction. Now, 30 m water map is used for width calculation at\n  90 m resolution. Currently river width is calculated for each channel separately\n  in braided/anabranching sections. Merged river width should be calculated.\n* Water body map: There are some inconsistencies between the DEM land sea mask and\n  wate body data (such as new islands along the coast). The quality of OpenStreeetMap\n  water body layer is not uniform in all areas.\n* Channel bifurcations: Channel bifurcation is not well represented in the current\n  version. Each pixel is assumed to have only one downstream direction. Secondary\n  (or multiple) downstream direction should be considered, to represent complex\n  river networks in the delta regions, floodplains, and braided rivers.\n* Underground rivers/tunnels: Major underground rivers/tunnels should be implemented\n  to improve large-scale water balance.\n* River/lake separation: Rivers and lakes need to be separated better for some applications.\n* Below-sea-level areas: The areas below sea level in coastal regions are not well\n  represented in adjusted elevation data.\n* Flow direction over glaciers: Flow direction over glaciers is not well represented,\n  because the elevation of glacier centerline is higher than glacier edge.\n* Supplementary data: It would be better to add location of GRDC gauging stations, water\n  falls, reservoirs, etc.\n\nData Sources:\n\n* [U-Tokyo MERIT DEM](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/index.html)\n* [U-Tokyo G1WBM water body data](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/G3WBM/index.html)\n* [OpenStreetMap water body layer](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/OSM_water/index.html)\n* [EC-JRC Global Surface Water Occurrence](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/G3WBM/index.html)\n* [U-Maryland Landsat forest cover data](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change)\n","license":"ODbL-1.0","providers":[{"name":"Dai Yamazaki (University of Tokyo)","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_Hydro/index.html"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/MERIT/Hydro/v1_0_1","rel":"self","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections","rel":"parent","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/","rel":"root","type":"application/json"},{"code":"JavaScript","href":"https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=Examples:Datasets/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1","rel":"related","title":"Run the example for MERIT/Hydro/v1_0_1 in the Earth Engine Code Editor","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/images/MERIT/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1_sample.png","rel":"preview","type":"image/png"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1#terms-of-use","rel":"license","type":"text/html"},{"href":"http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_Hydro/index.html","rel":"license","type":"text/html"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[],"type":"Collection","id":"MODIS/006/MCD12Q1","title":"MCD12Q1.006 MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global 500m [deprecated]","description":"The MCD12Q1 V6 product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals\n(2001-2016) derived from six different classification schemes.

GLDAS-2.2 product suites use\ndata assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are\n\"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as\nDA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2\nproducts.GLDAS-2.0 is one of two components of the GLDAS Version 2 (GLDAS-2)\ndataset, the second being GLDAS-2.1. GLDAS-2.0 is reprocessed with\nthe updated Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset\n(Sheffield et al., 2006) and upgraded Land Information System\nVersion 7 (LIS-7). It covers the period 1948-2010, and will be extended\nto more recent years as corresponding forcing data become available.\n\nThe model simulation was initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil\nmoisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for\nthat day of the year. The simulation used the common GLDAS datasets\nfor land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask\n(MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds, 1999), and\nelevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in\nthe current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used\nin GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [Readme](https://hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/GLDAS/GLDAS_NOAH025_3H.2.0/doc/README_GLDAS2.pdf)\n\n* [How-to](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto?tags=hydrology)\n\n* [GES DISC Hydrology Documentation](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/documents?title=Hydrology%20Documentation)\n\nProvider's Note: the names with extension _tavg are variables\naveraged over the past 3-hours, the names with extension '_acc' are\nvariables accumulated over the past 3-hours, the names with extension\n'_inst' are instantaneous variables, and the names with '_f' are\nforcing variables.\n","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"NASA GES DISC at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"https://doi.org/10.5067/342OHQM9AK6Q"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_GLDAS_V20_NOAH_G025_T3H"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1948-01-01T03:00:00Z","2014-12-31T21:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/NASA/GLDAS/V20/NOAH/G025/T3H","rel":"self","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections","rel":"parent","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/","rel":"root","type":"application/json"},{"code":"JavaScript","href":"https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=Examples:Datasets/NASA_GLDAS_V20_NOAH_G025_T3H","rel":"related","title":"Run the example for NASA/GLDAS/V20/NOAH/G025/T3H in the Earth Engine Code Editor","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/images/NASA/GLDAS/NASA_GLDAS_V20_NOAH_G025_T3H_sample.png","rel":"preview","type":"image/png"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_GLDAS_V20_NOAH_G025_T3H#terms-of-use","rel":"license","type":"text/html"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[],"type":"Collection","id":"NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_MONTHLY_V06","title":"GPM: Monthly Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) v6","description":"IMERG-Final version \"06\" stopped being produced in September, 2021.\nVersion \"07\" is expected to be released in September 2022\n\nGlobal Precipitation Measurement (GPM) is an international\nsatellite mission to provide next-generation observations of\nrain and snow worldwide every three hours.

In addition, since LCZs were\noriginally designed as a new framework for urban heat island studies, they\nalso contain a limited set (7) of 'natural' land-cover classes that can be\nused as 'control' or 'natural reference' areas.\n\nAs these seven natural classes in the LCZ scheme can not capture the\nheterogeneity of the world's existing natural ecosystems, we advise\nusers - if required - to combine the built LCZ classes with any other\nland-cover product that provides a wider range of natural land-cover\nclasses.\n\nSee also:\n\n* [LCZ Typology](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00019.1)\n\n* [Global map of LCZs - paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3835-2022)\n\n* [Global map of LCZs - dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6364593)\n\n* [LCZ Gaussian filtering](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00605-z)\n","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"Bochum Urban Climate Lab","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"https://lcz-generator.rub.de/global-lcz-map"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/RUB_RUBCLIM_LCZ_global_lcz_map_v1"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/RUB/RUBCLIM/LCZ/global_lcz_map/v1","rel":"self","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections","rel":"parent","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/","rel":"root","type":"application/json"},{"code":"JavaScript","href":"https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=Examples:Datasets/RUB_RUBCLIM_LCZ_global_lcz_map_v1","rel":"related","title":"Run the example for RUB/RUBCLIM/LCZ/global_lcz_map/v1 in the Earth Engine Code Editor","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/images/RUB/RUB_RUBCLIM_LCZ_global_lcz_map_v1_sample.png","rel":"preview","type":"image/png"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/RUB_RUBCLIM_LCZ_global_lcz_map_v1#terms-of-use","rel":"license","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3835-2022","rel":"source"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6364593","rel":"cite-as"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[],"type":"Collection","id":"SKYSAT/GEN-A/PUBLIC/ORTHO/MULTISPECTRAL","title":"Planet SkySat Public Ortho Imagery, Multispectral","description":"This data from Planet labs Inc.

Its objective is to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology\nand advancements in change detection to produce a \"best available\" map of landscape change.\n\nOutputs include three annual products: change, land cover, and land use.\nChange relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast loss (which also\nincludes hydrologic changes such as inundation or desiccation), and gain. These values are\npredicted for each year of the Landsat time series and serve as the foundational products for\nLCMS. Land cover and land use maps depict life-form level land cover and broad-level land use\nfor each year.\n\nBecause no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble of models as\npredictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of ecosystems and change processes\n(Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer\na holistic depiction of landscape change across the United States over the past four decades.\n\nPredictor layers for the LCMS model include annual Landsat and Sentinel 2 composites, outputs\nfrom the LandTrendr and CCDC change detection algorithms, and terrain information.

Mosaicked burn severity\nimages are compiled annually for each year by US State and the continental\nUnited States.\nMonitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) is an interagency program whose goal\nis to consistently map the burn severity and extent of large fires across all\nlands of the United States from 1984 to present. This includes all fires 1000\nacres or greater in the western United States and 500 acres or greater in the\neastern Unites States. The extent of coverage includes the continental U.S.,\nAlaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe program is conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Earth\nResources Observation and Science (EROS) and the USDA Forest Service Geospatial\nTechnology and Applications Center (GTAC). MTBS was first enacted in 2005,\nprimarily to meet the information needs of the Wildland Fire Leadership Council\n(WFLC).  The primary objective at that time was to provide data to the WFLC for\nmonitoring the effectiveness of the ten-year National Fire Plan. The scope of\nthe program has grown since inception and provides data to a wide range of\nusers. These include national policy-makers such as WFLC and others who are\nfocused on implementing and monitoring national fire management strategies;\nfield management units such as national forests, parks and other federal and\ntribal lands that benefit from the availability of GIS-ready maps and data;\nother federal land cover mapping programs such as LANDFIRE which utilizes burn\nseverity data in their own efforts; and academic and agency research entities\ninterested in fire severity data over significant geographic and temporal\nextents.\n\nMTBS data are freely available to the public and are generated by leveraging\nother national programs including the Landsat satellite program, jointly\ndeveloped and managed by the USGS and NASA. Landsat data are analyzed through a\nstandardized and consistent methodology, generating products at a 30 meter\nresolution dating back to 1984. One of the greatest strengths of the program is\nthe consistency of the data products which would be impossible without the\nhistoric Landsat archive, the largest in the world.\n\nYou can visit the [MTBS Project Website](https://www.mtbs.gov) for more\ninformation.\n\nYou can also visit the\n[MTBS Data Explorer](https://apps.fs.usda.gov/lcms-viewer/mtbs.html)\nto learn more and interact with the data.\n","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS)","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"https://mtbs.gov"},{"name":"USDA Forest Service (USFS) Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC)","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/gtac"},{"name":"United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center","roles":["licensor","producer"],"url":"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USFS_GTAC_MTBS_annual_burn_severity_mosaics_v1"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-135.286387,20.38379,-56.446306,52.459364]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","2021-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/USFS/GTAC/MTBS/annual_burn_severity_mosaics/v1","rel":"self","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections","rel":"parent","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/","rel":"root","type":"application/json"},{"code":"JavaScript","href":"https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=Examples:Datasets/USFS_GTAC_MTBS_annual_burn_severity_mosaics_v1","rel":"related","title":"Run the example for USFS/GTAC/MTBS/annual_burn_severity_mosaics/v1 in the Earth Engine Code Editor","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/images/USFS/USFS_GTAC_MTBS_annual_burn_severity_mosaics_v1_sample.png","rel":"preview","type":"image/png"},{"href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USFS_GTAC_MTBS_annual_burn_severity_mosaics_v1#terms-of-use","rel":"license","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/","rel":"license","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/","rel":"source"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[],"type":"Collection","id":"USGS/3DEP/10m","title":"USGS 3DEP 10m National Map Seamless (1/3 Arc-Second)","description":"This is the seamless 3DEP DEM dataset for the U.S.\nwith full coverage of the 48 conterminous states, Hawaii, and\nU.S. territories.

The Rangeland\nCondition, Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (RCMAP) product aims to\ncapture this response by quantifying the percent cover of rangeland\ncomponents, associated error, and trends across the western U.S. using\nLandsat imagery from 1985-2020.\n\nRCMAP quantifies the percent cover of components across the western U.S.\nrangelands (after Rigge et al. 2020) using Landsat imagery from 1985-2020.\nThe RCMAP timeseries consists of eight fractional components: annual\nherbaceous, bare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial\nherbaceous, sagebrush and shrub, and the temporal trends of each. The four\nprimary components (bare ground, shrub, litter, and herbaceous) are designed\nto sum to 100% in each pixel when added to tree canopy cover. The secondary\ncomponents annual herbaceous and perennial herbaceous are subsets of the\nprimary component herbaceous, while non-sagebrush shrub and sagebrush are\nsubsets of shrub. Secondary components cannot have cover greater than their\nrespective primary component. One year, 2012, was excluded from\nthe timeseries due to a lack of quality imagery.\n\nMRLC developed an automated method to identify change in spectral\nconditions between each year in the Landsat archive and the circa 2016 base\nmap. Regression tree models were trained from the unchanged portions of each\nyear in the time series. Post-processing models corrected post-burn\ntrajectories and eliminated noise and illogical change in the predictions.\nThe current generation of RCMAP has been improved with more training data,\nregional-scale Landsat composites, and more robust change detection. MRLC\nassessed the temporal patterns in each component with a linear model and\nstructural change method which determines break points in the timeseries\nusing an 8-year temporal moving window. The linear and structural change\nmethods generally agreed on gross patterns of change, but the latter found\nbreaks more often with most pixels having at least one break point. Data\nprovide spatiotemporal information on the occurrence of breaks, but even\nmore critically, attribute those change events to specific component(s).\nThe spatially, temporally, and thematically (i.e., multi-component) detailed\nspecific information on rangeland condition can contribute to understanding\nmajor patterns of change at local, regional, and continental levels.\n\nSee also:\n\n* Rigge, M., C.

No below-ground values were assigned to croplands as ratios were unavailable. Above-and-below-ground biomass were then summed together and multiplied by 0.5 to convert to carbon, generating a single above-and-below-ground biomass carbon layer.\nThis dataset has not been validated.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Bouvet, A. et al. 2018.
